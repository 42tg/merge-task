# Thought Map

1. First of I read the Task and decided to setup the Initial Repository to work in. As this is a very small task I choose the Test Driven approach to always have an working solution.
The Setup itself is an small Typescript Project with Jest as Testing Framework. Since those Typescript setups always consume Time to setup I created the Function with an hard coded return value to have a working Test.
Why Typescript instead of pure Node? I try to avoid pure JS and force myself to use Typescript as much as possible in my Projects. Besides that it's a long time ago since I setup an Node Project with Typescript from scratch and using this as an opportunity to refresh my knowledge.
